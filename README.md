## Note about a somewhat consensus trust driven decentralized computing system

Objective :
a Community overlay network of distributed ressources

A community is a set of computation, storage, bandwidth, contents and implemented application.
The main aims is to offer an internet overlay shared by a community, hosted, and computed by its members.
Providing ressources to the community should be incentivized.

### componments:

* defined by smart contract (see DOUG)
* a thelonius like  blockchain providing a verified set of ressource along with permission set  
* a local proxy that handle access to signature  and inject in dom trusted script
* a distributed p2p storage, signaling and communication, cryptographic system.

* all peer can provide commodity and service such as bandwidth, storage,connectivity, relying applications and be rewarded for.
* using such services can cost any value including 0. :)
* equilibrium should be found in order to maintain the network. 

 


## crypto, privacy, security

* all security sensitive operation should be done outside browser
* basically each user is defined by a set of  tryptic (addr, pubkey, privkey )  signed by a threshold numbers of co member.
* private ressource should be crypted on storage, by default ressource are private. 
* user keys can be revoked and assets transfered by multi sig tx ( modality defined in the DOUG ).

##incentives
* favorise uptime
* resilience long regularly refreshed ressource
* fast responses
* would be great to have incentive on running or deploying popular script
* tx for init, refresh, publish, subscribe
* storage cache

### step so far..

Tested some contract with thelonius work at some point, need getter to check state of execution of smart contract blockchain
tested ethereumjs-lib, webtorrent, and some webrtc, framework
Looked at a bunch of code :)
