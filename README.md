## Note about a somewhat consensus trust driven decentralized computing system

Objective : 
a Community overlay network of distributed ressources

A community is a set of computation, storage, bandwith, contents and implemented application.
The main aims is to offer an internet overlay shared by a community (think an entreprise vpn), hosted, and computed by its members
providing ressource to the community should incentivized.

### componments:

* a thelonius blockchain providing a verified set of ressource ( hash ) pointer along with permission set  
* a v8 process instrumented in order to measure its ressources consumption and constraint its footprint to a know set of feauture
* a distributed p2p storage 


##incentives

* defined by smart contract (see DOUG)
 
* resilience long regurlarly refreshed ressource
* fast responses 

* fast bootstrap generation need 3 peers
* uptime favorized in ratio
